# SeniorDesign
#This script takes the sensor readings (accelerometer, gyroscope, and ppg data on all axes) and performs operations on these inputs to manipulate them and to extract key information from them.
#The features that are extracted in this script include peaks from a reading's Fourier transform, power spectral density, and jerk (time-domain)
#Additional capability includes noise reduction for ppg data to extract heartrate
